Nat Borchers Save

I hate that defenders don't get the recognition they deserve. Just today when the MLS Starting XI was selected, only 3 defenders were selected and 3 forwards were selected. This is frustrating considering every single team has at least 4 defenders, sometimes 5, in the modern game, and usually 2, sometimes 1 (occasionally 3, but not really) players up top.

Anywho, this will never change, its just how sports are. Scoring gets the recognition, nothing's going to change that, whatever.

I just wanted to make sure that Nat Borchers' save in tonight's match got the recognition it deserved. Its crazy that it wasn't Moment of the Match. Well, I guess not crazy. But I would've loved to see it be. Because that was a hell of a save, and so important.
