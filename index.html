I have done work with Android development as an intern at Concur Technologies. I'm particulary interested in game development and I'm taking a class in game archiecture this spring semester.</div>

<p align="center">Download the Tetris AI that I programmed for my Artifical Intellignce class (CS 4700). The game was programmed by Brendan Jones at <a href="http://psnbtech.blogspot.com/2012/10/tutorial-java-tetris-game.html">http://psnbtech.blogspot.com/2012/10/tutorial-java-tetris-game.html.</a> This was a group project I worked on with two other students and we came up with an algorithm to calculate the next best move for the AI player to make (whom we named "Bart") based on the current state of the Tetris board. The AI would then make the move happen in the game. I added the "Bart.java" class and edited a few of the other classes to fit the "Bart" AI.</p>
