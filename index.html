          <p class="riht">I am a student entering my senior year at Cornell University enrolled in the the College of Engineering as a Computer Science major. I have done work with Android development as an intern at Concur Technologies as well as a 3 Day Startup event at Cornell, and I'm currently working as the Javascript Team Lead for a startup called ToonChat. I particularly enjoy front-end development, creating aesthetic and intuitive user interfaces.</p>

          <p><a href="Tetris-master.zip" download="Tetris">Download the Tetris AI</a> that I programmed for my Artifical Intellignce class (CS 4700). The game was programmed by Brendan Jones at <a href="http://psnbtech.blogspot.com/2012/10/tutorial-java-tetris-game.html">http://psnbtech.blogspot.com/2012/10/tutorial-java-tetris-game.html.</a> This was a group project I worked on with two other students and we came up with an algorithm to calculate the next best move for the AI player to make (whom we named "Bart") based on the current state of the Tetris board. The AI would then make the move in the game. I added the "Bart.java" class and edited a few of the other classes to fit the "Bart" AI.</p>
