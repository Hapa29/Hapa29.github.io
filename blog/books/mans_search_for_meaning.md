by Viktor E. Frankl

_1/26/2020_

## Summary

> "...achieving something through his own suffering."

> "Suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a 
sacrifice."

> "...harvest of their lives: the deeds done, the loves loved, and ...the sufferings they have gone through with courage and dignity."

There are 3 things that give life meaning: 
1. Goals/accomplishments
2. Experiences/pleasure
3. Suffering nobly

## Takeaways

I feel that the first two points are somewhat intuitive. But the third is a bit more profound. Frankl came
to the conclusion that "suffering nobly" could give life meaning through his experiences in the 
concentration camps of the Holocaust. He found that, while some men gave up the will to live because
they believed there was no change to escape the camps and no hope of accomplishments or pleasure in 
the future, others found the will to live. They were able to do so, because they found their 
suffering to have meaning. 

For one thing, they were suffering in order to survive. To finish some work, or to live so that they
may be reunited with a loved one. One's attitude about suffering can change if one can find a 
purpose in it.

But other could find meaning in being given the opportunity to suffer well. To show heroism in the
face of adversity. "Achieving something through his own suffering."

His theories gave practical value in his career as a psychiatrist. It was interesting how he was
able to frame one man's suffering in such a way that it gave him purpose, and helped ease it. In 
this instance, the man deeply missed is late wife and grieved for her. Frankl pointed out that if
his wife had not passed away, then it would be his wife who would be the widow, and she would be
grieving just the same. By this man being the one to survive, he had saved his wife this suffering.

I'm glad that I took the time to read the biographical summary in the Afterword at the end of the 
book. Mr. Frankl had an inspirational life. I particularly found that his ability to not blindly
hate Nazis and Germans despite his experience to be admirable. He observed in his time in the 
concentration camps that there were good and bad individuals on both sides within the camp.

In the _Like Stories of Old_ video essay ["The Fantasy of Ultimate Purpose"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSLb3COkAHg),
the narrator makes the observation that we enjoy movies, books and stories because the characters
have a deep sense of purpose. Despite the fact that they are often suffering, we fantasize about 
being in their shoes. Think of zombie apocalypse movies, lone detectives, or superheroes. I know
I've fantasized about being in situations like the one on the show _Lost_. Having a distinct sense 
of purpose, essentially, is the meaning of life.
