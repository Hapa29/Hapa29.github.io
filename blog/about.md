# Why am I doing this?
The goal of this blog is to record and organize my thoughts in a blog format. I have no imminent 
plans to share this actively. Maybe at some point. I have several reasons for writing a publicly
 accessible blog like this:
1. The act of organizing and writing thoughts as though I needed to share them and convey ideas to
 someone else will give me a chance to thoroughly dive into an idea and develop it.
2. Prototyping. To see what I really enjoy writing about, so that I may pursue that further and 
actually write things that I would share.
3. To harvest my thoughts, because it is my hope that one day I will want to share these.
4. Writing as though I will share it and putting it out there where anyone could see it makes more 
exciting.

## What goes here?
All my thoughts. I have a bunch scattered through my Google docs. I would like to curate them and
bring them over here (well, maybe not _EVERYTHING_).

I'll treat my thoughts I record in Google Docs as quick notes, drafts to be ported over here.

## Is this a "Project"?
Yes, for now I will treat it as such. But my hope is this is something I could do in parallel...
whenever I get the itch. This would be difficult to scope.
