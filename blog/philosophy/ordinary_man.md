# Ordinary Man with Nothing To Do
_4/5/2020_

_"Try to be just an ordinary man with nothing to do."_

I swear that I got this quote from 
[Viktor E. Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning)
(wrote a post about it [here](../books/mans_search_for_meaning)), but I can't seem to find the quote
anywhere...may have copied it down incorrectly. Or maybe I'm just clever? Wherever it came from, it 
stuck out to me and I think I could benefit from applying it to my life more.

To me, it kinda says "Chill out, nothing really matters. You're just a person." I think I can get 
wrapped up in getting things done, living life to the fullest, being a good person, being successful,
accomplishing, yachta yachta yachta. This quote reminds me to bring things back to reality, and
don't try to do too much. Because after all, nothing really matters. You're just a person who will
die someday and return to the earth. And that's okay. There's a beauty in that simplicity.
