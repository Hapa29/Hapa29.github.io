# Don't Get Attached to Things

_Plop!_ Murphy settles herself down in a nice patch of grass, holding up a stick between her front 
paws at a slight angle as she vigorously chomps down on it with her molars. I allow her to enjoy 
herself and I continue walking down the winding path through the south-west corner of Prospect Park.
Once I’m about 20 yards ahead she gets up, stick in mouth, and chases after me. She runs ahead 20 
yards or so and plops down again, continuing her chewing session. We repeat this cycle throughout
our half hour walk, wishing for nothing else in the world, because what could be better?

Murphy loves chewing on things. Chews. Bones. Sticks. Stuffed animals (well, more like ripping 
those to shreds). It’s sometimes a bit exasperating, because I take her to the park to in order for 
 her to get nice and tired before I leave her for work. But she only runs around for several moments
 before finding a new stick and lying down to enjoy it. So I have to take it from her so that she'll
 get up and actually move around (this time, in search of a new _better_ stick).

What's remarkable is that, as much as she loves the stick in those fleeting moments of chewing 
bliss, she’s not attached it. She enjoys the chewing as it’s happening. She’ll try to bring it along
 as far as she can (right up to the doorstep). But I can always take it away from her. She won’t 
 growl at me or bite if I reach to take whatever's in her mouth (or reach in her mouth), and she may
 look at me expectantly for a second after taking the object, but then she moves on to whatever the 
 next grand adventure is.

I think we can learn a lot from Murphy. Buddhists believe that attachments lead to suffering, and I 
think Murphy shows me how not being attached to something that brings her so much joy can make life 
easier. Enjoy it while you have it. But don’t fight it leaving. It might be for your own good, 
because maybe it’s time to get some exercise, or go inside so you can have a nice hearty dish of 
kibble, or maybe you’ve had too many bones and you’re going to have diarrhea if you keep devouring 
them at the current rate.
